Hi Susan,

My name is Peter Martinson, and I live just down the street from your store on Rees Ave.

I was brainstorming business ideas recently, and it hit me that I hate buying from Amazon when I could just go buy something from a nearby store.  So I came up with an idea to create an online marketplace that lets people see products that are currently available at local stores and then make the purchase online.  Probably they would just then walk to get the thing they bought, but I haven't gotten that far with the idea yet.

This might work well for Via Bellissima too - someone could search for "dinner plates", and come up with your blue dinnerware set.  The price is at least competitive with the junk sold on Amazon, and the buyer would be supporting local business while getting a unique plate set.

If you have five minutes today or tomorrow, I would love to speak on the phone and get your opinion on this project and learn about other challenges your business faces.

Thank you,
Peter Martinson
